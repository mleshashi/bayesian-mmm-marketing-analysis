# ðŸ“ˆ Marketing Channel Effectiveness Analysis using Bayesian MMM

This project uses **Bayesian Media Mix Modeling (MMM)** with `pymc-marketing` to analyze the impact of different marketing channels (TV, Radio, Banners) on sales.

## Key Objectives

- Understand how different channels contribute to sales.
- Model **lagged** and **saturated** effects of media spend.
- Perform **prior/posterior predictive checks** and diagnostics.
- Evaluate model performance using **CRPS**.
- Estimate **Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)** per channel.
- Recommend **optimized budget allocation** to maximize future sales.

## Highlights

- TV has the strongest correlation with sales, but Banners deliver the **highest ROAS**.
- The model generalizes well, showing better performance on test data.
- Budget optimization yields **higher expected sales** than naive allocation.

## Tech Stack

- Python, PyMC, pymc-marketing, ArviZ, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pandas
